# Kickstarter-Analysis
A global analysis of the factors that lead to successful Kickstarter campaigns

a.	The Kickstarter campaign categories that have the most submissions and the most successes in rank order are theater, music and film and video.

b.	The sub-category “plays” receive by far the most submissions and have the largest number of successful campaigns. 

c.	It seems that submitting a Kickstarter idea earlier in the year (Feb-May) is more likely to be funded than submitting later in the year (Sept-Dec). Additionally, lower goal targets are more likely to be successful.
