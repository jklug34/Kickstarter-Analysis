# Kickstarter-Analysis
A global analysis of the factors that lead to successful Kickstarter campaigns

•	The Kickstarter campaign categories that have the most submissions and the most successes in rank order are theater, music and film and   video. 

•	The sub-category “plays” receive by far the most submissions and have the largest number of successful campaigns.  

•	Submitting a Kickstarter idea earlier in the year (Feb-May) is more likely to be funded than submitting later in the year (Sept-Dec).     Additionally, lower goal targets are more likely to be successful.
